## Purpose
The purpose of this usability testing is to evaluate the effectiveness and clarity of our logging system.

By engaging users in a hands-on experience with a pre-configured environment, we aim to observe how they interact with the logs to identify and resolve errors. 

This will provide valuable insights into the user experience and help us improve the log design for better troubleshooting and error resolution.

## Background
### Objective:
We intend to use a GitHub repository in conjunction with MyBinder to provide participants with direct access to a ready-to-use environment.

This environment will include a purposely failing job, simulating a real-world scenario where users must rely on log outputs to find and fix issues.

## Exercises
1. **Environment Setup**: Participants will access the pre-configured environment via a MyBinder link connected to our GitHub repository. This environment will have all necessary tools and a failing job ready for investigation.

2. **Job Execution and Log Analysis**:
  - Participants will run the failing job and observe the generated logs.
  - They will be asked to navigate through the logs to pinpoint the source of the error.

3. **Problem Identification and Resolution**:
  - Once the error is identified, participants will attempt to rectify the issue based on the information available in the logs.
  - They will then rerun the job to see if their fix was successful.

4. **Feedback Session**:
  - After the exercises, participants will provide feedback on their experience.
  - This will include questions about the clarity of the logs, ease of finding errors, and overall user experience in debugging.
